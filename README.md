**Overview:**
India‚Äôs quick commerce boom, fueled by Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, and Dunzo has brought lightning-fast deliveries. But what happens when that speed sacrifices quality? Expired groceries or damaged food can leave a bad taste (literally!).

Current systems rely on frustrating phone calls or chats, often ending with delayed cashbacks. But what if resolving these issues took just minutes?

But imagine resolving these issues in just minutes! ‚è≥

## Introducing Snap Back üõí

SnapBack is an AI-powered, Web3-integrated platform designed to redefine how customer complaints are handled in the **quick commerce industry**. While our initial focus is on resolving food-related complaints, SnapBack is evolving to address broader issues in quick commerce, such as damaged packages for e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon, or vegetable freshness concerns for platforms like BigBasket and JioMart.  

SnapBack also introduces **AI Tokens**, a novel tokenomics model that rewards users and drives the usage of AI agents for complaint resolution.  

## üí° How SnapBack Works  

1. **Complaint Submission:**  
   - Users log in with their Web3 wallet.  
   - Upload complaint details, including text descriptions and image evidence.  

2. **Data Storage:**  
   - Complaint data is stored on IPFS/Filecoin for transparency and accessibility.  
   - Metadata is logged on-chain via a smart contract.  

3. **Complaint Processing:**  
   - VLMs validate complaints by analyzing image and text data.  
   - If valid, the process proceeds to resolution; otherwise, users are notified.  

4. **Automated Resolution:**  
   - Smart contracts handle refunds, cashback, or discounts.  
   - NFTs are minted as proof of resolution.  

5. **Token Creation:**  
   - AI Tokens are generated for every AI agent interaction.  
   - Tokens can be used within SnapBack‚Äôs ecosystem for rewards or redeemed for benefits.  

6. **Escalation:**  
   - Complex complaints are reviewed by human agents.  
   - Updates are logged back on-chain.  

7. **Closure:**  
   - Users receive final updates and can retain the minted NFT as a record.
