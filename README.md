### **How SnapBack Works**

#### **1. User Interaction:**
- **Complaint Submission:** Customers can easily submit a complaint using a streamlined, user-friendly interface.
- **Issue Description:** Users select the food item in question, describe the issue (e.g., missing item, wrong order, poor quality), and upload a photo of the food.
  
#### **2. Complaint Processing:**
- **VLM Analysis:** The system utilizes advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs) to interpret both the uploaded images and text descriptions.
  - **Image Recognition:** The VLM identifies the food item in the image.
  - **Text Understanding:** It cross-references the text description to understand the nature of the complaint (e.g., portion size, burnt food).
- **Validation:** Once the AI validates the complaint by matching image and description details, it moves to the next phase.

#### **3. Automated Solutions:**
- **Policy Review:** Based on company policies and the type of complaint, the system suggests an appropriate resolution, such as offering cashback or a discount.
- **Limits on Automation:** Automated resolutions will have a predefined limit on attempts. If unresolved after a set number of tries, the system escalates the issue to human support.

#### **4. Real-time Feedback:**
- **Updates:** Customers will receive live updates on their complaint status, including whether compensation is granted, and if so, the percentage of cashback or discount offered.

#### **5. Human Oversight:**
- **Escalation:** In cases where automated solutions fail, or the customer remains unsatisfied, the system escalates the issue to human agents for further review and resolution.
